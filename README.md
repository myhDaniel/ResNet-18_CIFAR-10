# ResNet-18_CIFAR-10
Image classification plays an important role in the applications of machine learning. As a simple practice, this project utilizes ResNet-18, which is capable of addressing the degradation problem, to classify CIFAR-10 with a resulting accuracy of 88.94% on the test set. The early-stopping strategy is employed to alleviate the model overfitting.
